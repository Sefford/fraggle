Grab the latest bundle from [here](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/sefford/fraggle/1.2/fraggle-1.2.aar)\r\n\r\n### Maven\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.sefford</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>fraggle</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.2</version>\r\n    <type>aar</type>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Gradle \r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ncompile 'com.sefford:fraggle:1.2@aar'\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Hooking Fraggle to your Activities\r\n\r\nFraggle can be used standalone or through a dependency injection framework as `Dagger` or `Guice`.\r\nHowever in order to use it you will need to manually inject the FragmentManager using the `init(FragmentManager fragment)`\r\nmethod, as a FragmentManager instance will not be available until you have created the Activity.\r\n\r\nCurrently this version of Fraggle only supports Android's native FragmentManager (API 14 onwards).\r\n\r\nUntil I do a support version, forking and using SupportFragmentManager is as simple as substituting \r\nthe instance  for a `Support Fragment Manager`. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n### Hooking Fraggle to your Fragments\r\n\r\nFraggle has an interface `FraggleFragment` to extend your Fragments with certain functionalities.\r\n\r\nThe first one is to enforce the Fragment to self-identify through the `getFragmentTag` method. This\r\nmethod is intended to provide the runtime identification for both logging purposes and as way for\r\nFraggle to look up Fragments in the backstack.\r\n\r\nAnother functionality available to FraggleFragments is to decide if there are customized behaviors \r\nfor clicking the Back Button using `hasCustomizedBackAction()` and `onBackPressed()` methods. The first\r\nis used to identify if the FraggleFragment itself has a customized action for clicking the back button,\r\nand the second to actually execute it. \r\n\r\nThe conditions will be only evaluated on the moment the user clicks on the back button, so the behavior\r\ncan be dynamically updated depending on certain conditions of the view. \r\n\r\nAdditionally the FraggleFragment can signal the FraggleManager to make a jump of several Fragments in\r\nthe backstack providing such Fragments exist, by looking up the backstack for a certain Fragment tag.\r\nIn order to activate this functionality the FraggleFragment must override `onBackPressedTarget()`\r\nmethod with a known tag. This can be used to perform hierarchical navigation or returning from long\r\nprocesses or error states to past Fragments. As with the previous point, this behavior can be changed\r\nin runtime depending of the flow of the application.\r\n\r\nThere is another addition in order to prevent endless cycles of navigation through your flow. This is\r\n`isSingleInstance()` method. It will signal the FraggleManager that before adding a new instance\r\nit should try to find and pop an existing instance of such Fragment. \r\n\r\nIn Fraggle there is a concept  known in Fraggle as `Entry Fragment`. An `Entry Fragment` is a Fragment such\r\nas popping back from the back stack should signal your activity to `finish()`. This is achieved by\r\nletting Fragments override `isEntryFragment()` method.\r\n\r\nFraggleFragment interface extends the Fragment lifecycle with `onFragmentVisible()` and `onFragmentNotVisible()`\r\nmethods for certain situations.\r\n \r\n### Instantiating new Fragments\r\n\r\nThe FraggleManager API is simple. In order to instantiate a new Fragment `addFragment()`\r\nshould be called. This takes five parameters:\r\n\r\n- Target fragment to add (must implement FraggleFragment).\r\n- Tag of the Fragment (can be obtained from the instance using `getFragmentTag`, but this way we give a chance to change it.\r\n- Fragment Animations bundle (optional) to add some eye candy to the transitions.\r\n- Configuration flags for the addition of the Fragment.\r\n- Target container ID.\r\n\r\nThe FraggleManager will configure properly the Fragment and perform the transaction.\r\n \r\nThe available flags for configuring a Fragment are:\r\n\r\n- `ADD_TO_BACKSTACK`: Default behavior. The Fragment will be added to the backstack.\r\n- `DO_NOT_ADD_TO_BACKSTACK`: The Fragment will not be added to the backstack.\r\n- `CLEAR_BACKSTACK`: The backstack will be cleared before the Fragment is added.\r\n- `DO_NOT_REPLACE_FRAGMENT`: The default behavior of FraggleManager is to replace the current Fragment for the new one. \r\nHowever, sometimes you will want to show the new over the current one, but when you pop back the old one, the Fragment\r\nlifecycle will not kick on because of you never removed the Fragment in the first place, for this situation overriding\r\nthe `onFragmentVisible()` extension will come in handy.\r\n\r\n### Popping back Fragments\r\n\r\nBefore popping back a Fragment, Fraggle will check out some conditions about the Fragment on top of the backstack.\r\n\r\n1. Know if the Fragment has a customized code that the Fragment must execute, then execute it.\r\n2. If not, check if it has to perform a jump by reading the `onBackPressedTarget()` tag. \r\n3. Execute the correct jump whether is popping a single element from the back stack, or a particular element.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that performing a `finish()` in the activity is not the responsibility of the FraggleManager,\r\nand the developer should take care of the correct conditions for his Activity to correctly finish. However,\r\nthe Activity can query the FraggleManager with `peek()` for the top Fragment and see if the `isEntryFragment()` method returns\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n    Copyright 2014 Sefford.\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
